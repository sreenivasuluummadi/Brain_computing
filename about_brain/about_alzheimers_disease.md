normal vs alzheimer
--------------------------------------------------
the alzheimer brain is smaller when compare with a normal human brain. it causes 60-70% because of dimentia . 
Alzheimer’s disease, one of the many types of dementias, causes severe damage to the brain. Without awareness of how this disease destroys the brain, 
it may be difficult to understand the loss of functioning that happens to an individual as the disease progress

In addition to the physical changes that can be seen between the brain of an individual with Alzheimer’s disease and 
the brain of an individual without the disease, there are also chemical changes that occur.

WHAT IS ALZHEIMER DISEASE:-
--------------------------------
Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. 
In most people with the disease—those with the late-onset type—symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. 
Early-onset Alzheimer’s occurs between a person’s 30s and mid-60s and is very rare.
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.





SIGNS OF MILD ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE:-
------------------------------------------
1.memory loss  
2.poor judgement leading to bad decision  
3.loss of spontanity and sense of initiative  
4.repeaing questions  
5.taking so much time to do daily works  
6.mood and personality changes  
7.increases anxiety or aggression  
8.wandering and getting lost  

Signs of Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease:-
----------------------------------------------
1.Increased memory loss   
2.Inability to learn new things  
3.Difficulty with language and problems with reading, writing, and working with numbers  
4.Difficulty organizing thoughts and thinking logically

5.Difficulty swallowing  
6.Groaning, moaning, or grunting

MEDICATON FOR ALZHEIMER'S:-
-----------------------------------
Alzheimer's is complex, and it is unlikely that any one drug or other intervention will successfully treat it. 
Current approaches focus on helping people maintain mental function, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow down the symptoms of disease

CAUSES:-
---------------
1.Genetics  
2.Cholinergic hypothesis  
3.Amyloid hypothesis  
4.Tau hypothesis

Alzheimer’s Disease is one of the biggest concerns many of us have as we get older. The thought of developing the disease can be a frightening prospect, especially if you’ve witnessed a loved one affected by dementia. 
While you may have been told that all you can do is hope for the best and wait for a pharmaceutical cure, the truth is much more encouraging. 
Promising research shows that you can reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s and other dementias through a combination of simple but effective lifestyle changes.


Get plenty of omega-3 fats more because we had a evidence given below
Evidence suggests that the DHA found in these healthy fats may help prevent Alzheimer's disease and dementia by reducing beta-amyloid plaques. 
Food sources include cold-water fish such as salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, seaweed, and sardines.
