# Detection of Alzheimers Disease using imaging and Biomarkers
The main aim of this project is early detection of alzheimers disease in order to treat it.Alzheimers disease have no cure but it can be prevented with some medication,so early detection of alzheimers disease using imaging and biomarkers can help a lot of people in prevention of the disease.The workflow of the project is as follows:  
1.Python  
2.Biomarkers of Alzheimers Disease  
3.Alzheimers Disease data acquisition and imaging  
4.Making machine learning pattern for alzheimers disesase  
5.Testing the accuracy using various machine learning models  
6.Finding out the difference between imaging and biomarkers  
  
  
  
    
  
    
      
      



A study and analysis of how brain works and altering the brain functionality  
For this the main work to do is to gain knowledge of technologies such as:  
1.PyCortex  
2.Free Surfer  
3.Open Neuro  
4.AFNI  
5.SPM  
After studying about all the related topics we can start thinking about solution for a particular problem.
Some of the problems that can be solved using brain computing is:  
* Alzheimer Disease  
* Cognitive disorder  
* Neuro Imaging and analysis(PET & MRI)  
* Genetic and Biofluid Variable  
* Disease characterisation  
* Brain Connectivity and Depression outcome solutions  
* Epidominal and lifestyle analysis  
* AI based radiomics biomarkers  
* Austim spectrum disorder
