# Brain_computing
A study and analysis of how brain works and altering the brain functionality  
For this the main work to do is to gain knowledge of technologies such as:  
1.PyCortex
2.Free Surfer
3.Open Neuro
4.AFNI
5.SPM
After studying about all the related topics we can start thinking about solution for a particular problem.
Some of the problems that can be solved using brain computing is:  
* Alzheimer Disease  
* Cognitive disorder  
* Neuro Imaging and analysis(PET & MRI)  
* Genetic and Biofluid Variable  
* Disease characterisation  
* Brain Connectivity and Depression outcome solutions  
* Epidominal and lifestyle analysis  
* AI based radiomics biomarkers  
* Austim spectrum disorder
