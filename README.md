# Brain_computing
A study and analysis of how brain works and altering the brain functionality
For this the main work to do is to gain knowledge of technologies such as:  
1:PyCortex<br>
2:Free Surfer<br>
3:Open Neuro<br>
4:AFNI<br>
5:SPM<br>
After studying about all the related topics we can start thinking about solution for a particular problem.
Some of the problems that can be solved using brain computing is:  
 *Alzheimer Disease  
 *Cognitive disorder  
 *Neuro Imaging and analysis(PET & MRI)  
 *Genetic and Biofluid Variable  
 *Disease characterisation  
 *Brain Connectivity and Depression outcome solutions  
 *Epidominal and lifestyle analysis  
 *AI based radiomics biomarkers  
 *Austim spectrum disorder
