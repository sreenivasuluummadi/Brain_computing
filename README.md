# Brain_computing
A study and analysis of how brain works and altering the brain functionality
For this the main work to do is to gain knowledge of technologies such as:
1:PyCortex
2:Free Surfer
3:Open Neuro
4:AFNI
5:SPM
After studying about all the related topics we can start thinking about solution for a particular problem.
Some of the problems that can be solved using brain computing is:
 ->Alzheimer Disease\n
 ->Cognitive disorder\n
 ->Neuro Imaging and analysis(PET & MRI)\n
 ->Genetic and Biofluid Variable\n
 ->Disease characterisation\n
 ->Brain Connectivity and Depression outcome solutions\n
 ->Epidominal and lifestyle analysis\n
 ->AI based radiomics biomarkers\n
 ->Austim spectrum disorder\n
