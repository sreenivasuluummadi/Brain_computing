# Brain_computing
A study and analysis of how brain works and altering the brain functionality
For this the main work to do is to gain knowledge of technologies such as:  
1:PyCortex<br>
2:Free Surfer<br>
3:Open Neuro<br>
4:AFNI<br>
5:SPM<br>
After studying about all the related topics we can start thinking about solution for a particular problem.
Some of the problems that can be solved using brain computing is:  
*Alzheimer Disease  
*Cognitive disorder  
*Neuro Imaging and analysis(PET & MRI)  
*Genetic and Biofluid Variable  
*Disease characterisation  
*Brain Connectivity and Depression outcome solutions  
*Epidominal and lifestyle analysis  
*AI based radiomics biomarkers  
*Austim spectrum disorder
